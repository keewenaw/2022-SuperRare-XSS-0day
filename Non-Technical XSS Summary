Objective: explain stored XSS vulnerability on SuperRare and why it matters
Audience: non technical 

Technical details = non-technical explanation

A Web3 marketplace = a vending machine
Core smart contracts running the marketplace = the vending machine always works as long as it has power
Website = the buttons you push to get your soda
Buttons may be broken but machine can still work
Stored XSS in the image vulnerability = vending machine eats your money 
No response from SuperRare = you can't get ahold of maintenance to get your money back
Public disclosure = putting a label over the money slot saying "don't buy anything, broken"


Ultra worst case scenario
Core smart contract broken = manufacturing defect with all vending machines
Hardfork upgrade = forced recall and replacement of broken machines
Old code = broken machines (you can still use them but why would you want to?)
